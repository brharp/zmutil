* Improve Packaging

Installing and verifying all of our customizations (scripts, theme
changes, etc.) should be as simple as unpacking this package on the
Zimbra server and running:

  make
  make test
  make install

For this to work, some changes are required:

  * all programs must compile cleanly,

  * test data must be available in data/,

  * tests written that check the programs in the zimbra environment,

  * hard coded paths (i.e. in `prov') parameterized.
